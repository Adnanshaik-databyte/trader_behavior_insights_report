📊 Trader Behavior Insights — Python Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes the relationship between individual trader performance and Bitcoin Market Sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) to uncover behavioral trading patterns. The goal was to generate actionable insights for systematic, sentiment-driven Web3 trading strategies.

📁 Dataset

Source: Hyperliquid & Alternative.me (Fear & Greed Index)

Files Used:

historical_data.csv — Trade-level performance data

fear_greed_index.csv — Daily Bitcoin market sentiment classification

The datasets include metrics such as PnL, trade volume, and daily sentiment scores.

🎯 Objectives

Explore correlation between trader profitability and market sentiment

Identify market conditions that maximize or minimize trading performance

Generate actionable insights for automated trading strategies

Visualize patterns in PnL, trade volume, and sentiment

📄 Analysis Structure

📍 Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation

Standardized and formatted trade and sentiment data

Handled missing values and aligned dates across datasets

📍 Step 2: Data Merging

Combined trader performance with market sentiment for unified analysis

📍 Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

PnL vs Sentiment

Trade Volume vs Sentiment

Time-series trends in profitability

📍 Step 4: Insight Generation

Contrarian trading patterns

Identification of profitable vs loss-prone market conditions

Recommendations for sentiment-based automated trading

📷 Visualizations

PnL vs Sentiment — Profit spikes during “Extreme Fear”

Volume vs Sentiment — Trading activity across sentiment levels

PnL Over Time — Trend of profitability vs market emotion

💡 Key Insights

Contrarian Strategy Works Best: Traders achieved peak profits during market panic (“Extreme Fear”)

Losses During Euphoria: Traders underperformed in “Greed” periods, highlighting risk of overconfidence

Actionable Strategy: Insights provide a foundation for automated trading rules using sentiment as a primary signal for capital allocation and risk management
