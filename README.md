Junior Data Scientist – Trader Behavior Insights

📊 Project Overview

An analytical project correlating individual trader performance with the Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset (Fear/Greed Index) to identify hidden patterns and deliver actionable insights for systematic Web3 trading.

🎯 Objective

The core objective was to explore the relationship between trader performance (PnL, Volume) and market emotion to determine if sentiment could be leveraged as a primary signal for developing smarter, automated trading strategies.

📌 Key Insights

The analysis identified a clear and highly effective Contrarian Trading Strategy.

Highest Profitability in Panic: The trader's success (profit/alpha) peaks when the market is in "Extreme Fear." This proves that buying into panic is the core source of profitable trades.

Highest Losses in Euphoria: The trader is consistently less profitable and often incurs losses when the market is experiencing "Greed."

Actionable Strategy: The outcome provides a strong framework for developing automated trading rules that use sentiment as a primary signal for capital allocation and risk management.
