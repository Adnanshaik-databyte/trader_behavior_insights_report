Junior Data Scientist ‚Äì Trader Behavior Insights

Assignment Objective

This project successfully fulfilled the objective of exploring the relationship between individual trader performance and overall Bitcoin market sentiment using two integrated datasets: the Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset (Fear/Greed Index) and Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid. The goal was to deliver actionable insights for building smarter, systematic trading strategies.

üöÄ Key Findings & Conclusion

The analysis identified a clear and successful Contrarian Trading Strategy.

The trader's primary success is derived from exploiting extremes in market emotion. The data confirms that profitability peaks when the market is in "Extreme Fear," while profitability is lowest during periods of "Greed."

This outcome provides a strong, data-driven framework for developing automated trading rules that use the sentiment index as a primary signal for capital allocation and risk management.

üìÇ Project Files

This repository contains the necessary files to review the analysis:

Input Data: historical_data.csv (Trader Metrics) and fear_greed_index.csv (Sentiment Data).

Analysis Code: Bitcoin_analysis.ipynb (The complete Python notebook for cleaning, merging, and analysis).

Final Deliverable: trader_behavior_insights_report.md (A structured report detailing the findings, insights, and recommendations).

Visual Evidence: Generated image files showing key charts (e.g., PnL Over Time, PnL vs. Sentiment, Volume vs. Sentiment).

üõ†Ô∏è How to Replicate

To replicate the analysis, clone the repository, ensure Python dependencies are installed, and run the cells within the Bitcoin_analysis.ipynb notebook sequentially.
